SWITCH DEBOUNCE
Switch debounce is Mechanical switches produce bouncing. Debouncing removes noise for clean
signals. Switch debounce is when a button is pressed or released, and it makes multiple rapid electrical contacts. This causes false multiple signals instead of one clean signal. There are 2 switches at the switch debounce which is A and B. A for active high which mean led will light up at 1 and B is active low which is it will light up at 0. If you press the switch for along time, the output will stay constant depending on the switch. A gives HIGH, B gives LOW, held state keeps signal unchanged. To test the switch debounce. You can connect it to 8 bit output led/ digital input (one of the led) to see the different between active high and low. If you connect active high then led will light off, when you press the button then led will light up. Next if you connect active low, then led will light up and when u press switch B, led will light off.


esp32
The ESP32 is the main microcontroller used on the Hybrid Digital Trainer to control and test digital circuits. It has Digital Output (DO) pins to send signals (such as to DO LEDs or 7-segment displays) and Digital Input (DI) pins to receive logic signals from switches, logic ICs, or other components. The input pins are DI0 to DI3, which correspond to Pin 34, 35, 32, and 33 on the ESP32. The output pins are DO0 to DO3, which are Pin 5, 27, 14, and 12. For safety, you must connect the signal to the Digital Input (DI) port first before reaching the ESP32 input pin, because the trainer board runs at 5V,while the ESP32 only supports 3.3V. The DI port includes a voltage divider (using 10kΩ and 20kΩ resistors) to safely reduce the voltage. To test output, connect the ESP32 output pins (Pin 5, 27, 14, 12) to the Digital Output (DO) port of the board, then connect jumper wires from DO to DO LEDs, 7- segment, or IC inputs. The ESP32 also supports UART communication to external modules such as HMI. The TX pin (Pin 1) from ESP32 should be connected to the RX pin of the HMI, and RX pin (Pin 3) should go to the TX pin of the HMI. Always ensure GND is shared between ESP32 and connected modules. This setup allows the ESP32 to control, test, and communicate with logic circuits safely and effectively. digital output The Digital Output (DO) section on the Hybrid Digital Trainer is used to display output logic states using LEDs, allowing students to visually confirm whether a signal is logic HIGH (1) or LOW (0). It functions as a simple indicator to test outputs from ICs. You can connect signals to DO from various sources such as debounce switches, clock output, ESP32 output pins, or 8-bit logic switches, but you must connect through an IC (e.g., NOT, AND, or other gates) before reaching the DO LED — direct connection from switch or logic source to DO LED is not recommended as it may not function correctly or damage components. When using debounce switches, pressing Switch A (active high) sends a HIGH signal to the IC, which is then processed and sent to DO. The LED on the DO line will turn ON or OFF depending on the logic inversion and LED polarity. This clean output confirms that the debounce circuit works and removes flickering. Similarly, logic switches or clock signals can be routed through ICs to DO, allowing for real-time testing of logic circuits and timing behavior. The DO section is flexible and supports a wide range of testing setups, but always ensure signals are routed properly through ICs and jumper wires for safe and correct operation. For more advanced use, the ESP32 can read DI inputs
through pins like Pin 34, 35, 32, or 33, which are input-only. Since ESP32 operates at 3.3V, while most trainer components use 5V logic, the DI section includes two resistors(typically 10kΩ and 20kΩ) that act as a voltage divider, safely dropping the voltage from 5V to around
3.3V before it reaches the ESP32. This prevents damage to the microcontroller and ensures stable
signal reading
digital input
The Digital Input (DI) section is used to safely send logic signals into the trainer system, especially to
microcontrollers like the ESP32, or to logic ICs for processing. Its main function is to receive digital
signals (either HIGH or LOW) from external sources such as debounce switches, 8-bit logic switches,
clock signals, or other circuits. You can connect a Switch A or Switch B directly to a DI pin to simulate
button input, or use any bit from the 8-bit logic switch to send a manual HIGH/LOW signal into the DI
section. The clock output can also be connected to a DI pin to test how timing pulses behave inside a
circuit. This digital input can also be controlled by the hmi and phone. For example, if u want to test
the ic. You can just light up 2 led at the digital input by using the hmi indicates high signal been sent.
timer clock
The Timer Clock (CLK) section generates a continuous square wave signal that alternates between
HIGH and LOW logic levels, used to control timing-based circuits like counters, flip-flops, or 7- segment
displays. The blinking speed or pulse frequency of the clock output can be adjusted using the rotary
potentiometer knob located in the clock section — turning it clockwise will increase the frequency,
making connected LEDs or circuits blink faster, while turning it counter clockwise will reduce the
frequency, causing slower blinking. You can connect the clock output to the input of an ICand observe
the result at the output pins, such as on the 8-bit LED or 7-segment display. For a simplevisual test,
you can connect it at 8 bit output led. You can see the led blink continuously or don’teven blink
because it too fast. What you can do right here, turn the potentiometer and you will led start to blink
because the potentiometer control the frequency.


7 segment
The 7-segment display is used to show alphanumeric characters, most commonly numbers (0–9) and
some letters (A–G), by controlling the seven individual segment lines labeled A to G. The display on
the Hybrid Digital Trainer is typically common cathode, meaning all the cathodes (negative terminals)
of the LED segments are connected together and should be connected to GND (ground), while each
segment is individually powered with a logic HIGH (1) to light it up. To power up the 7- segment, first
connect the common cathode pin to ground, then supply HIGH signals to specific segment pins
depending on the character you want to display — for example, to show the letter A, you must activate
segments A, B, C, E, F, and G. This can be done using jumper wires from sources like the 8-bit logic
switch. The connection methods include: (1) manual control using 8-bit logic switches where you
connect each switch line to a segment and toggle HIGH/LOW manually; (2) automated control using
clock + IC like 4026, where the IC output is wired directly to the segment pins for counting displays.
logic testing using DI outputs from the board, which may be routed through NOT gates depending
on configuration. Always ensure each segment receives a properHIGH signal, and optionally use
resistors to protect the segments from overcurrent.8 bit logic switch
The 8-bit logic switch functions as a manual input to provide HIGH (1) or LOW (0) digital signals across
eight lines for testing purposes. the switch sends 5V to the connected circuit, lighting up an LED or
activating logic inputs; touch it again routes the output to ground (0V), turning the signal OFF.If you
touch it for a long time, you can see the led getting brighter or fade. For connections, you can:
(1) connect each switch line directly to the 8-bit output LED to observe binary patterns, (2) connect
any switch output to the input pins of logic ICs, (3) connect four switches (bit 0–3) to 7-segment
decoder IC to drive a 7-segment display, connect to flip-flop ICs for memory/control testing.


HMI DISPLAY
The HMI (Human-Machine Interface) display functions as a visual and interactive interface between
the user and the Hybrid Digital Trainer, allowing data from the ESP32 or trainer board to be displayed
in real time and enabling control through touch buttons or on-screen menus. It communicates with
the ESP32 via UART, where the TX pin of the ESP32 (Pin 1) is connected to the RXpin of the HMI, and
the RX pin of the ESP32 (Pin 3) is connected to the TX pin of the HMI, with a shared GND connection
to complete the circuit. This setup allows the HMI to receive output data such as sensor readings, LED
status, or test results, and to send user commands back to the ESP32for processing. By providing a
graphical interface, the HMI replaces the need to monitor multiple LEDs or raw IC outputs directly,
making it easier for students to observe system behavior and interact with the trainer effectively. So
next is the way on how to connect HMI display to our phone, firstly plug in the USB cable (power bank/
charger adapter) to power up the digital trainer. After connecting it in, u can just touch the on/off at
the power section below. Next, HMI display will automatically show Wi-Fi SSID, Password and IP
address. Then go to Wi-Fi setup at your phone. Find and connect the Wi-Fi name shown on the screen.
Enter the password required and wait until it connected. After Wi-Fi connected, open browser at your
phone (google/ safari). Type the IP address shown on the HMI display and search. This part will load
the Digital Trainer control interface. Trainer interface will appear on your phone. You can now view
and control the trainer using your phone or HMI display. What you can see from the hmi is digital input
and digital output. Digital input can just be controlled by the hmi. Just click the button and you will see
the led light up. If the digital output receive high signal then u can see the digital output part (for
example DO1) light up.


IC CONNECTION
For example IC 7408, the input pin is pin 1 and 2 while the output pin is pin 3. Ground located at pin
7 and vcc located at pin 14. To test this ic, you can connect it to any section that got led such as digital
output, 8 bit output led. For the input part, you can connect it to digital input or connect directly to
5v. The digital input also can be controlled by the hmi and your phone, when you light up the led that
is mean you supply 5v to the ic. If you light up 2 digital input then you provide 1 and 1 and your output
at digital output will be one. You can see it light up at the hmi or your phone. This process applied to
AND gate since you are using ic 7408.
HMI DISPLAYFor the digital output at the hmi, It can be connected with ic output pin when u test the ic. If u
connect directly with 5V u can also see it light up the digital output part on the hmi.
